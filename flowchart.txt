1. Importing the packages
2. Exploring the dataset 
    Brain MRI Classification
        Binary
        Multi-Class
3. Image processing
	- using Image Data Generator 
		- Re-scaling the Image
		- Shear Transformation
		- Zooming the Image
		- Horizontal Flip 
		- Reshaping the Image 
4. Building the model 
    ResNet18
    ResNet34
    ResNet50 - backbone of SSCLNet
    DenseNet201
    Xception
5. Training the model
6. Building the model 
Flask Framework
----------------
7. Flask Framework with Sqlite for signup and signin
8. Importing the packages
9. User Upload an image for analysis
10. The given input is preprocessed 
11. The trained model is used for predicting the result
12. Final Outcome is display 
Dataset 
--------------
Binary: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection 
Multiple :

Extension
--------------
In the base paper, the author mentioned to use  SSCLNet model and  compare with others ResNet18 and ResNet34 model for analysis the different Brain Dataset from which SSCLNet got 69% of accuracy, 
As an extension we have applied Xception, DenseNet201 for analysis Dataset, in which may get 90% of accuracy or above ,
With the above As an extension we can build the front end using flask framework for user testing with authentication.
